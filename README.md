A GitHub repository containing my final report for my Directed Research Project which involved independently studying various topics in group theory, including representation theory as well as Lie Groups and Lie Algebras. 

In the project report, group theory is utilised to determine the vibrational modes of the $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ molecule.

The PDF file is the final project report that was submitted to the supervising professor. 

The ZIP file contains all of the LaTeX code for the project report.
